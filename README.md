# About

What we have here is a rather rudimentary implementation of a client-server architecture using the Scala language and Java Sockets from the standard library.

The client enters the ISBN of a book that they want to check the price of. The server then checks for that ISBN in its in-memory database and returns the price to the client. Great. How wonderful.

# Prerequisites

You'll need to install [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org) and [**sbt**](https://www.scala-sbt.org) on your system to run this program. Consult the links I've provided for official installation instructions.

# Installation

Simply `git clone` this repository,

    git clone https://github.com/PScoriae/BasicScalaSockets

# Running the Program

Honestly, I dislike Java and Scala, or whatever runs in the JVM and enforces OOP.

It's also been a while since I ran this code or gave a damn about it. So, unlike a typical README that you'd find in my other repos, you're gonna have to figure it out yourself.

From what I recall, I don't think it's that hard to run, right? Something along the lines of `sbt compile` and `sbt run`. Have fun.
